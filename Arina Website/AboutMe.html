			<h2>About Me</h2>

				<p>	A personal career goal of mine would be to determin the life style I would like to live
				
				and the style job I would like to have in the near future. I started thinking outside the box, something that is not very 
				
			   achievable for me in my life, something very current. I came across engineering as my next goal to reach. My entire family 
			   has experience with engineering which lead me into that direction. I've always thought
				Attending a four year college right after high school, but turns out it is way to pricey and you can 
				get the same general education through a two year at a community college and then do a transfer. 
				I am following my brothers foot steps and trying to get the education that he got in college. 
				The coolest subject I have learned
				
				from engineering was for sure how to create this website. It took a while to get the hang off, but I did feel accomplished of the result in the end.
				
				Engineering is a very hard subject for me, but I am getting there one step at a time.</p>
				
				
				
			<p> Right now I'm a Senior at Dublin High School.
			
			I originally came to the United States from Lithuania and I lived there untill I was about 8 years old.

			I speak Russian fluently and understand quiet a lot of Lithuanian.

			I achieve good grades to reach my goal which is continue my education to college. I joined leadership in 8th grade
			
			which was a lot of fun to be part of a community as big as leadership. Senior year of high school 
			I had some room in my schedule and decided to join leadership. I've lead multiple of events which has taught me responsibility
			and how to be a better leader.
		    My biggest strength my ability to communicate with anyone, I talk to anyone who comes my way. My biggiest weakness would be 
		    misjudgment of a situation.
			</p>
			
			<p>	I love working with a different people because this extends my knowledge and keeps me occupied. If I were
			to make it into the engineering field I would love to work with different people all over who can incourage me in
			doing my job.

			Other activities I've done would be figure skating, and when I was younger I used to do gymnastics. I'm at

		Dublin High School and I've never been happier.I am planning to  

			reach my goal with computer science. I've started to learning a new language called Java, it's a lot more 
			difficult then the other languages I have learned, but Im hoping to take a more experienced class sometime soon.
