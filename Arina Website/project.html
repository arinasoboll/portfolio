				<p>This project was done individually over the course of two weeks. We did not do documentation, only coding the project 
				and then presenting it in front of the class. This was a game called Tic Tac Toe, in which I took a starter code 
				and added math problems into it. You are playing a fun game as well as learning how to add numbers from 1 to 100. 
				This game was targeted towards elementary schoolers but could have also changed code to learn about any other topic. 
				If you answer the problem correcrtly, you get to pace your piece wherever you desire. If you do not get the problem correct
				then you lose your turn and your partner goes. The code uses random numbers once you are playing the game. Some hardships 
				I had during this project would be figuring out what type of code I need to use, and how to accomplish this 
				within the time spam I had. In the end I acomplished what I had planned for, and had a well working app.</p>

				<h2><b>Community Helper Project</b></h2>
				<h3><b>When :</b> <em> 12/4/17-12/15/17  </em> </h3>
				<h3> <b>Course :</b><em> AP Computer Science </em> </h3>
				<h3><b> Group Project</b></h3>
			    <p> This project required a group of 2-4 people, we had to create a pototype, a full documentation, and 
				a presentation in front of the class. This was successfully planned out due to the time we had. In the 
				end our app looked almost like the protype, we didn't have enough time to add all the color changes we would 
				have liked. The app was called Comminity helper, which had a youtube live stream, plus all the events that are going on 
				in your area. This app was supposed to basically help you in your knowledge of your surroundings. Some challanges we faced
				were off course error with our code, and finishing our app on time for the due date.<a href = "https://docs.google.com/a/dublinusd.org/presentation/d/1nnjy2Yw2X9SrvRbKOaSbmfBkMtvHRhiZQyvNC6eVEeA/edit?usp=sharing" hspace="20"> Link To Presentation</a></p>

				<h3 style="color:black;"><em>More Projects in the future.</em></h3>
				<p>The project my team of four decided to create was to come up with a way we can attach pockets  
				to women jeans. We noticed that women do not have pockets in most jeans and workout pants,
				they are usually presented as fake pockets or even not big enough to fit necessary everyday items. We took 
				left over cloth from our closets and sowed a banker clip which easily clips on your side jeans. We made the 
				pocket big enough and steardy enough for everyday use.
				The entire group did do a good amount of work overall, everybody worked on the document as well as 
				sow one side of either the final design or prototype. One challenge we for sure overcame 
				was how to sow very well to create a beautiful pocket for our costomers. All of us had a lot of good team 
				work and we shared all the work equally depending on how much time we had. I loved creating this project because 
				we were all super fond of our idea and had a lot of fun figuring out a way to create these pockets.

      			
		<h2><b>Solor Hydrogen Vehicle</b></h2>

				<h3><b>When :</b> <em> 11/2/16-11/17/16 </em> </h3>
				<h3> <b>Course :</b><em> Princibles Of Engineering </em> </h3>
				<h3><b>Team Project</b></h3>
				<p>This project was the most recent we created which is giving a suggestion to a Tesla Company explaining 
				which would be a better vehicle improvment. Either a hydrogen cell car or a solar cell car. With the group suggestion
				we came up with, the solar cell seemed to work out a lot better then the hydrogen cell which did not move to fast compared
				to solar cell which had more movement.With this project my team learned a lot about working under pressure when 
				some of our technology would not work as well as we hoped which did set our team back a few days. I specifiacally learned 
				how to think of different stratagies on putting together cars in different ways. For example we had a vision in mind
				that completely changed when the vehicle would not move. We had to re design the originial design. We added on different 
				modifications to speed up the car for a better efficiency. My specific role in this project was to create the google
				documentation as well as help out with building the vehicle itself the day of the building. Working as a team really did pay 
				off in this project, we all did log on late at night to figure out our conclusions in the end. The team participated 
				in every part of the project going through one step at a time. <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bzWI82K_Lv09CmH3PTVq0yF2Z60vWU4I33uEOm5Mvmc/edit?usp=sharing" hspace="20"> Website</a>

		<h2><b>Entrepreneurship Project</b></h2>
				<h3><b>When :</b> <em> 5/13/16 - 6/2/16 </em> </h3>
				<h3> <b>Course :</b><em> Computer Science Engineering </em> </h3>
				<h3><b>Team Project</b></h3>
				<p> The next project I did for computer programming was the <em>Entrepreneurship Project</em> This project was a team
				effort project but it mostly felt like it was an individual project. The goal was to create something that hasn't been
				created yet or add on to something that has already been created. The point of this project was to think outside of the box
				and try and come up with something that helps the world.fgWith this society a lot of things have already been created so it was 
				very challenging to create something that hasn't been created yet. We came up with the idea of a <em>Medical Bracelet</em>. This bracelet
				was meant to help elders be able to be found when they walk off somewhere and do not remember how to get back. This project was a 
				two week process and there was two write ups as well as a presentation. The bumps that we came across would be trying to figure out 
				how to create the website we did as well as finishing this project up on time. This project gives you an oppurtinity to be as 
				creative as you want to be and have fun in creating what you want to create. This project also gives people the opportunity to
				participate in a Computer Engineering Competition for the students that got picked. I feel that this project gave students 
				a good feeling on how they would want to help the world.

				<h2><b> Video Player Project</b></h2>
				<h3><b>When :</b> <em> 12/7/15 - 1/8/16  </em> </h3>
				<h3> <b>Course :</b><em> Computer Science Engineering </em> </h3>
				<h3><b> Partner project</b></h3>
				<p> The point of this project was to create an app. 
				We had a selection of apps to choose from. You could have created a game or 
				any type of app that you wanted to pick from.
				I worked with a partner, the project my partner and I picked would be to create a video player. 
				This video was supposed to have three videos, those three videos were picked 
				by the website link but after we created the coding we added different videos 
				that we downloaded from Youtube. I learned that if you do not have enough space for a video 
				app inventor will not play this video, it would not download this video at all, 
				I also learned how to code with a dfferent environments.I feel that my partner and I had good team work
				and we both improved on our coding. We had a lot of problems and we overcame them. We could not upload a few videos because 
				of the space storage. We also couldn't find a tool that we needed to and we couldn't complete our code.</p>
			


				<h3 style="color:black;"><em>Hangman Project</em></h3>
      			<p><img src="images/Hangman2.png" width="600" height="400" align="left" > </p>
			
				<h2><b>Hangman Project</b></h2>
				<h3><b>When :</b> <em> 3/21/16 - 3/25/16  </em> </h3>
				<h3> <b>Course :</b><em> Computer Science Engineering </em> </h3>
				<h3><b> Partner project</b></h3>
				<p>The next project that we did would be the <em>Hangman Project</em> which is where you physically create a hangman 
				game and you guess what the letters would be and the code tells you if you have guessed the right letter or the wrong letter.
				This project was a very neat idea, and a lot off fun to create with a partner. The image below shows the entire code
				that we created with this project.The point of this project was to practice python coding and looking at it 
				with a different perspective.Throughout the project we stumbled on a few problems in the begining and on how to write the 
				actual code. But throughout we got through the whole project and everything worked out perfect in the end.
				We also added a cool feature to where if you lose, a hangman pops up and erases an arm. which was my partners 
				idea and it was a very neat and cool idea. I learned that there are so many different ways you could write this code, you could 
				make it really hard or it could be a simple code. This all depends on how you look through the code and 
				how your mind processes to create this code.
				This was a week long project and after we had a gallery walk and we got feedback 
				from our peers, which I feel like is always a good idea. If you scroll all the way down
				you can see the pictures off all of the projects that I have done with partners or without.
