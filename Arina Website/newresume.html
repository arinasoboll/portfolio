				<h2>Feild trips attended</h2>

				<ul><p> One feild trip that I attended was for half the day at google and the second half at Santa Clara college.
				Touring google for the first time was a great experience. The entire class had came and sat down to listen 
				to google employees talking about their day to day lives and how google works. The second half was Santa Clara 
				State university, which was a great college. They had a lot of rooms for students to do their hands on projects.
				A lot of their rooms we were able to view and walk around. We later on had lunch at their huge cafeteria. There 
				wasa lot of variety for what kind of food you wanted to eat which was great. 
				The second field trip I went to was the Bio-Rad field trip. Which was an amazing experience, we had the chance to view every
				thing at Bio-Rad, as well as talk to who worked there. We were also given the oppportunity to  create some test droplets with 
				the materials that they all use on a daily basis.This was an amazing field trip which gave me a well rounded understanding 
				behind the science(biology) side of engineering.
				
				</p></ul>
				
					<h2>Speakers</h2>

				<ul><p> Two speakers I have heard who took their times out of their busy lives was a man named Sathish Pottavathini who explained
				to us how Linkedin works. Which is basically a site that helps millions and millions of people find jobs 
				all around them. He talked about how to create a job, and what would be good information to put into 
				your portfolio. This young man gave me a very good understanding on how to usethe online community 
				to my advantage.
				The second guest speaker who came in was a man named Otavio, who explained to us what Artificial 
				intelligence was. He originally did not attend college, as a child he took a huge interest in coding
				which is hwy he later on realized that is his true passion. Him and a few friends graduated high school
				went to college for a semester and realized that it was not for them. They all decided to come up with an idea
				and create that. Their idea was to help people that may not speak the same language as you do, and use an ipad to translate 
				what that person may be saying. Due to this the app had exploded on the app store which gave him a very steady job at 
				this very moment in his life.
				</p></ul>
				
					<h2>Mentor Ship Program</h2>

				<ul><p> At dublin high school there is an acedemy for engineering students. This academy provides a huge amounts 
				of opportunities, one of them is the mentorship program. Which was the academy teachers picking a mentor that they 
				may think will bond good with you. My mentor was a man named Roddy Kwan, he would come join me every single month 
				and we discussed what was on the agenda. We edited my resume, talked a lot about what my goals were for the year, talked about 
				my near future and my college goals. He as well shared a lot of his college experinces as well as brought in a resume for me to 
				look at and try to make mine sound better. IF we both were not able to attend the meetings we would make a follow up 
				phone call to talk about what we might have missed. Or even we would do a make up meeting. This experince has given me 
				a great understanding on how to set my goals as well as how I want to pursue my dreams.
